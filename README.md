## How It Works

This mod uses the **Harmony** patching library to override the default world time getter method in the game. By hooking into the game’s `World` class, it intercepts the time calculation and forces it to remain at **night** (world time set to 25000, which corresponds to night in the game).

### Key Technical Details

- **Target Method**: The mod targets the `SetWorldTime` or equivalent method in the `World` class (using Harmony’s reflection system).
- **Patch Logic**: The patch forces the game to skip over its default world time getter and instead always return the value for **night**.

## How to Use

Once the mod is installed:
- **No configuration is needed**: The world will always remain at night.
- You can modify the mod's source code if you wish to adjust the time of day or enable specific conditions for when it becomes night.

## Troubleshooting

- **Mod not working?** Ensure you have placed the mod in the correct folder: `7DaysToDie/Mods/AlwaysNight/`.
- **Harmony issues?** Make sure that the Harmony mod is installed and properly initialized.
- **Game crashes**: If the game crashes or behaves unexpectedly, check the mod log for any errors related to time patching.
